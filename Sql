I have been hired by a retail company to analyze their sales data and provide insights for decision-making. The company has provided me with several datasets stored in a relational database, including:

Orders: Contains information about orders placed, including order ID, customer ID, order date, and total amount.

Order Details: Provides details about each product in every order, including order ID, product ID, unit price, quantity, and discount.

Customers: Contains customer information such as customer ID, name, address, and contact details.

Project Objectives:
Data Extraction: Write SQL queries to extract relevant data from the provided tables (Orders, OrderDetails, Customers).

Data Transformation: Create SQL scripts to clean and transform the data into a format suitable for analysis. This may involve handling missing values, data normalization, or data type conversions.

Analysis Queries: Write SQL queries to answer the following questions:

Total sales for each year.
Top 5 products by revenue.
Monthly sales trends.
Customer buying patterns (e.g., repeat customers, average order size).
Sales by geographical region.
Reporting: Develop SQL queries to generate reports that summarize the findings from your analysis. For example:

Monthly sales report with comparisons to previous years.
Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.
Product performance report.
Approach:
1. Data Extraction:
Write SQL queries to retrieve data from the Orders, OrderDetails, and Customers tables.
Use joins to combine relevant information (e.g., join Orders and OrderDetails on OrderID).
2. Data Transformation:
Clean and preprocess the data as needed (e.g., handling NULL values, converting data types).
Aggregate data for analysis purposes (e.g., calculate total sales, average order size).
3. Analysis Queries:
Use SQL aggregation functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) to compute metrics such as total sales, average order size, etc.
Utilize window functions (if supported by your SQL dialect) for tasks like ranking top products.
4. Reporting:
Write SQL queries to generate reports in a tabular format.
Consider using SQL reporting techniques such as GROUP BY for summarizing data and CASE statements for conditional logic in reports.

SQL Statements:


Total Sales for Each Year:
SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear, SUM(TotalAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM Orders
GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate)
ORDER BY OrderYear;



SQL Query: This query calculates the total sales for each year by extracting the year from the OrderDate column, summing up the TotalAmount for each year, and then grouping the results by OrderYear.
Rationale: It provides a yearly overview of sales performance, helping to identify trends and patterns over time.
Insights: By visualizing this data in a line chart or bar chart, you can easily see which years had the highest sales, any growth or decline trends, and make comparisons between different years.


Top 5 Products by Revenue
SELECT ProductID, SUM(UnitPrice * Quantity * (1 - Discount)) AS Revenue
FROM OrderDetails
GROUP BY ProductID
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

SQL Query: This query calculates the revenue generated by each product by multiplying UnitPrice, Quantity, and (1 - Discount) for each order item, summing these values for each product, and then selecting the top 5 products based on revenue.
Rationale: It identifies the best-performing products in terms of revenue, which is crucial for inventory management and marketing strategies.
Insights: Visualizing this data in a horizontal bar chart or pie chart helps in understanding which products contribute the most to overall sales, potentially guiding decisions on stock levels and promotional efforts.

Monthly Sales Trends:
SELECT YEAR(OrderDate) AS OrderYear, MONTH(OrderDate) AS OrderMonth, SUM(TotalAmount) AS MonthlySales
FROM Orders
GROUP BY YEAR(OrderDate), MONTH(OrderDate)
ORDER BY OrderYear, OrderMonth;

SQL Query: This query calculates monthly sales by extracting the year and month from OrderDate, summing TotalAmount for each month, and grouping by both OrderYear and OrderMonth.
Rationale: It reveals seasonal patterns and fluctuations in sales, aiding in forecasting and resource planning.
Insights: Visualizing this data in a line chart or area chart shows monthly sales trends over time, helping to identify peak months, seasonal variations, and potential factors influencing sales fluctuations.

Customer Buying Patterns:
SELECT CustomerID, COUNT(*) AS TotalOrders, AVG(TotalAmount) AS AvgOrderAmount
FROM Orders
GROUP BY CustomerID
ORDER BY TotalOrders DESC;

SQL Query: This query calculates the total number of orders (TotalOrders) and the average order amount (AvgOrderAmount) for each customer by grouping orders by CustomerID.
Rationale: It segments customers based on their buying behavior, identifying valuable customers and patterns in purchasing frequency and order size.
Insights: Visualizing this data using a histogram or scatter plot helps in understanding customer segmentation, loyalty, and potential opportunities for personalized marketing strategies or customer retention initiatives.


Sales by Geographical Region (assuming regions are in Customers table):
SELECT C.Region, SUM(OD.UnitPrice * OD.Quantity * (1 - OD.Discount)) AS RegionSales
FROM Orders O
JOIN OrderDetails OD ON O.OrderID = OD.OrderID
JOIN Customers C ON O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
GROUP BY C.Region
ORDER BY RegionSales DESC;

SQL Query: This query calculates sales by geographical region (Region) by joining the Orders, OrderDetails, and Customers tables, summing the revenue for each region.
Rationale: It analyzes regional sales performance to identify high-performing markets and potential areas for growth or improvement.
Insights: Visualizing this data on a map or using a bar chart grouped by region helps in visualizing regional sales distribution, understanding regional preferences, and informing regional marketing strategies or distribution decisions.
